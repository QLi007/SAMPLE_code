Scripts used to simulated reinforcement learning algorithms on chimeric protein engineering datasets.

The files needed to run simulations are:
- load\_data.py
- tools.py
- trial\_types.py

Scripts made to actually carry out and analyze the simulations:
- sim.py
- analyze.py

All .data files hold datasets used in the simulations. The sample\_CBHII dataset is the CBHII dataset with only parent and sample 1 datapoints.

\_run directories hold data from specific runs.

The Old directories holds obsolete and unneeded files.
